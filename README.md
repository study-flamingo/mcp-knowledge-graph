# Enhanced Knowledge Graph Memory Server with Temporal Observations

An advanced implementation of persistent memory using a local knowledge graph with temporal observation support. This lets Claude remember information about users across chats with intelligent time-based categorization and automatic cleanup of outdated information.

## üÜï What's New in v0.7.0

- **Temporal Observations**: Observations now include timestamps and durability categories
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatically remove outdated temporary observations
- **Enhanced Search**: Search through both string and temporal observation formats
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing string observations work seamlessly
- **Unified API**: Single `add_observations` tool supports both formats

## Core Concepts

### Entities

Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:

- A unique name (identifier)
- An entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "event")
- A list of observations (now supporting temporal metadata)

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "John_Smith",
  "entityType": "person",
  "observations": [
    {
      "content": "Speaks fluent Spanish",
      "timestamp": "2025-06-26T18:45:00.000Z",
      "durability": "permanent"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Relations

Relations define directed connections between entities. They are always stored in active voice and describe how entities interact or relate to each other.

Example:

```json
{
  "from": "John_Smith",
  "to": "Anthropic",
  "relationType": "works_at"
}
```

### Temporal Observations

Observations now support temporal metadata to distinguish between permanent facts and temporary states:

#### Durability Categories

- **`permanent`**: Never expires (e.g., "Joel is a dentist", "Has ADHD")
- **`long-term`**: Relevant for 2+ years (e.g., "Uses CareStack software", "Owns a dental practice")
- **`short-term`**: Relevant for ~6 months (e.g., "Planning to sell practice", "Experiencing burnout")
- **`temporary`**: Relevant for ~1 month (e.g., "Currently learning TypeScript", "Traveling to Dominica")

#### Observation Formats

```json
{
  "entityName": "John_Smith",
  "observations": [
    // Simple string (defaults to long-term)
    "Likes coffee",
    
    // Temporal object with durability
    {
      "content": "Currently learning TypeScript",
      "durability": "temporary"
    },
    
    // Permanent fact
    {
      "content": "Is a dentist", 
      "durability": "permanent"
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Reference

### Core Tools

#### **create_entities**

Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph.

**Input**: `entities` (array of objects)

- `name` (string): Entity identifier
- `entityType` (string): Type classification  
- `observations` (string[]): Associated observations

**Behavior**: Ignores entities with existing names

#### **create_relations**

Create multiple new relations between entities.

**Input**: `relations` (array of objects)

- `from` (string): Source entity name
- `to` (string): Target entity name
- `relationType` (string): Relationship type in active voice

**Behavior**: Skips duplicate relations

#### **add_observations** ‚≠ê Enhanced

Add observations with optional temporal metadata.

**Input**: `observations` (array of objects)

- `entityName` (string): Target entity
- `contents` (array): Mix of strings and temporal objects

**Content formats**:

```javascript
// Simple strings (default to long-term)
["Likes coffee", "Uses Windows PC"]

// Temporal objects with durability
[
  { content: "Is a dentist", durability: "permanent" },
  { content: "Learning TypeScript", durability: "temporary" },
  "Also likes tea" // Mixed formats work together
]
```

**Returns**: Added observations with full temporal metadata

### Temporal Management Tools

#### **cleanup_outdated_observations** üÜï

Automatically remove observations that have exceeded their durability timeframe.

**Logic**:

- `permanent`: Never removed
- `long-term`: Removed after 24 months
- `short-term`: Removed after 6 months  
- `temporary`: Removed after 1 month

**Returns**: Summary of entities processed and observations removed

#### **get_observations_by_durability** üÜï

Retrieve observations grouped by durability category.

**Input**: `entityName` (string)

**Returns**: Object with arrays for each durability level:

```json
{
  "permanent": [...],
  "longTerm": [...], 
  "shortTerm": [...],
  "temporary": [...]
}
```

### Standard Tools

#### **delete_entities**

Remove entities and their relations.

#### **delete_observations**  

Remove specific observations from entities.

#### **delete_relations**

Remove specific relations from the graph.

#### **read_graph**

Read the entire knowledge graph.

#### **search_nodes**

Search across entity names, types, and observation content.

#### **open_nodes**

Retrieve specific nodes by name.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations

```javascript
// Create an entity
create_entities([{
  name: "Dr_Smith",
  entityType: "person", 
  observations: ["Works at City Hospital"]
}])

// Add temporal observations
add_observations([{
  entityName: "Dr_Smith",
  contents: [
    { content: "Is a cardiologist", durability: "permanent" },
    { content: "Recently promoted to department head", durability: "long-term" },
    { content: "Currently on vacation", durability: "temporary" },
    "Speaks three languages" // Defaults to long-term
  ]
}])
```

### Temporal Management

```javascript
// View observations by durability
get_observations_by_durability("Dr_Smith")

// Clean up outdated information
cleanup_outdated_observations()
```

### Advanced Usage

```javascript
// Create relations
create_relations([{
  from: "Dr_Smith",
  to: "City_Hospital", 
  relationType: "works_at"
}])

// Search across all content
search_nodes("cardiologist")
```

## Installation & Setup

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "enhanced-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/memory/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/your/memory.jsonl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `MEMORY_FILE_PATH`: Custom path for memory storage (default: `memory.json`)

## System Prompt for Temporal Memory

Here's an enhanced system prompt that leverages temporal features:

```
# Memory Tool Usage

Follow these steps for conversational interactions:

## User Identification:
You should assume that you are interacting with default_user (Dr. Joel)
If you have not identified default_user, proactively try to do so.

## Memory Retrieval:
Always begin a new conversation by retrieving all relevant information from your knowledge graph
Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"

## Memory Gathering:
While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
a) Professional Identity (dental practice details, specializations, software development skills, certifications, business roles, etc.)
b) Practice Management (patient care protocols, treatment preferences, scheduling patterns, equipment, software systems, workflow optimizations, etc.)
c) Technical Projects (current development projects, programming languages, frameworks, AI tools, automation workflows, deployment environments, etc.)
d) Learning & Development (new technologies being explored, courses taken, conferences attended, skill gaps, learning goals, etc.)
e) Professional Network (dental colleagues, software development contacts, AI/tech community connections, business partners, mentors, etc.)
f) Task Management (recurring responsibilities, project deadlines, patient appointment patterns, development milestones, automation opportunities, etc.)
g) Tools & Systems (practice management software, development tools, AI assistants, productivity apps, integrations, pain points, etc.)
h) Business Operations (practice metrics, revenue goals, efficiency improvements, technology investments, growth strategies, etc.)

## Memory Update with Temporal Awareness:
If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory using appropriate durability:

**Permanent**: Core identity, fundamental skills, permanent relationships
- "Joel is a dentist", "Has ADHD", "Full name is Dr. Joel Casimir"

**Long-term**: Stable preferences, established systems, long-term goals
- "Uses CareStack software", "Enjoys rock climbing", "Prefers TypeScript"

**Short-term**: Current projects, temporary situations, 6-month goals  
- "Planning to sell dental practice", "Learning new MCP features"

**Temporary**: Immediate tasks, current states, monthly activities
- "Currently working on memory server", "Traveling next week"

Use add_observations with appropriate durability categories for new information.
Regularly run cleanup_outdated_observations to maintain data quality.
```

## Data Format & Migration

### JSONL Storage Format

The server uses JSONL (JSON Lines) format for efficient streaming and backward compatibility:

```jsonl
{"type":"entity","name":"Dr_Smith","entityType":"person","observations":[...]}
{"type":"relation","from":"Dr_Smith","to":"City_Hospital","relationType":"works_at"}
```

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing string observations are automatically converted to temporal format
- Old JSONL files work without modification
- Default durability is "long-term" for legacy data

## Building & Deployment

### Local Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker Build

```bash
docker build -t enhanced-memory-server .
```

### Development

```bash
npm run watch  # Auto-rebuild on changes
```

## Performance & Scalability

- **Automatic normalization** of legacy string observations
- **Efficient search** across mixed observation formats  
- **Smart caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Incremental cleanup** of outdated observations
- **Optimized JSON storage** for better parsing performance

## TypeScript Features Demonstrated

This project showcases modern TypeScript patterns:

- **String literal types** for durability categories
- **Union types** for backward compatibility  
- **Optional properties** with defaults
- **Interface composition** and extension
- **Type guards** for runtime type checking
- **Generic constraints** for type safety
