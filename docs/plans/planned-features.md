# Planned Features

## Multiple Memory Contexts

We plan to implement a memory context system that allows users to define and switch between multiple memory files. This feature will support both static named contexts and dynamic project-based memory paths, enabling AI models to access different memory stores for different projects while maintaining a clear and safe user experience.

## Entity Versioning and Update Operations

We plan to implement version tracking for entities and relations in the knowledge graph, enabling history tracking and evolution of knowledge over time. This enhancement will be accompanied by new update operations that allow modifying existing entities and relations while preserving version history. Additionally, we'll add flexible configuration options through environment variables and Docker containerization support for easier deployment.
